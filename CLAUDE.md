# Project notes for Claude

## Working preferences (from Dan, dan@rec.us)

- **Always share the Railway PR-preview URL** whenever I open a PR for this repo,
  without being asked — Dan wants to click through the change before merging.
- **Wire a Slack activity notification into every new user-facing surface** —
  new features, buttons, export/download options, and other notable interactions
  should ping the Slack activity feed, without being asked. Dan wants visibility
  into what's being used (and enjoys the vanity of seeing plays/exports roll in).
  See the section below for the exact mechanism.

## Slack activity notifications — wire every new surface (IMPORTANT)

Standing rule (see Working preferences): any new button, export, download, or
notable interaction ships WITH a Slack activity ping. Don't wait to be asked.

The mechanism lives in `server.js` under "Slack activity notifications":

- `SLACK_NOTIFY` — the Set of event names that actually post to Slack. Add the
  new event name here or it stays silent.
- `SLACK_EVENT_META` — `{ emoji, verb }` per event; the default message reads
  `${emoji} ${orgName} (\`slug\`) ${verb} *${report}*`. Add a custom branch in
  `notifySlack()` if you need extra fields (see the `email` / `game` branches).
- Debounce: `notifySlack()` dedups by `${org}|${report}|${event}` for
  `SLACK_DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_MS` (60s). Give an event a custom debounce key there if
  distinct sub-events (e.g. per-game, per-recipient) should each post.
- Server-side events (a route the server handles, e.g. the Puppeteer `pdf`) call
  `logEvent(org, report, event, req, extra?)` directly — it appends to the events
  JSONL AND calls `notifySlack`.
- Client-side events (things the server can't see — a client export, a button
  click, a mini-game) beacon `POST /:org/:report/api/log?event=<name>[&extra=…]`
  (fire-and-forget, `keepalive: true`), and the event name must be in that route's
  `ALLOWED` list. Pass extra context as query params and thread them through as the
  `extra` object into `logEvent`.

Wired so far: `created`, `pdf`, `excel`, `print`, `summary` (🧾 lite export),
`game` (🕹️ hidden banner mini-game plays), `view`, `insights`, feedback/votes,
`email`. Inert unless `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set (prod has it).

## Metabase card updates via API/MCP — template-tag types reset (IMPORTANT)

Updating a card's SQL through the Metabase API/MCP (`construct_native_query` +
`update_question`) regenerates ALL template tags as **Text** — date tags lose
their Date type, so this server's `date/single` parameters stop matching and the
public card returns "An error occurred." (the app then serves stale cache).
**After ANY programmatic card update, Dan must open the card in the Metabase UI
and flip each date variable (Start Date / End Date) back to type Date.** Batch
card updates so Dan can do all the flips in one visit, verify with a
server-style parameterized request afterward, and never assume a card update is
done until that verification passes.

## Card sign-off — a report MUST return live results before you call it done (IMPORTANT)

Learned the hard way (2026-08-06 → 2026-08-09): the shared Fast Track card was
edited and started **timing out** for large orgs (`canceling statement due to
statement timeout`). The app silently fell back to stale cache, so the report
kept *looking* fine while every live refresh failed — and the daily health
check was fooled the same way (it saw a warm cache hit and never re-probed
Metabase). **Nobody noticed for 3 days.** A warm/stale cache masks a card that
no longer returns fresh data, so "it still renders" is NOT proof it works.

**Rule: after ANY card edit (SQL, template tags, or a Metabase upgrade), confirm
the card actually returns fresh, non-empty rows via a cache-independent live
request — for the HEAVIEST org (biggest = worst case for timeouts), not a small
one.** Never sign off on a warm-cache render alone.

Tooling for this:

```
node scripts/verify-report-live.js --manifest scripts/report-cards.manifest.json
```

It hits the Metabase **public** card endpoint directly (same URL + parameter
shape server.js uses, incl. the required parameter `id`), so no app cache can
hide a broken card. It **fails (exit 1)** on error, empty result, or timeout.
Add a `{card, org}` row to `scripts/report-cards.manifest.json` whenever a new
shared card or large org is onboarded, and run it as the last step of every card
change. Single-card form:
`node scripts/verify-report-live.js --card <uuid> --org <orgId> [--start --end --timeout --min-rows]`.

## Tyler/Munis "GL Account Detail" export (card 20197)

The 🏛️ **Tyler** button on the GL report (Pawnee only) streams a Munis-format
`glgatddt` account detail — PDF for reading, `.csv` for loading. Server-rendered:
`lib/munis.js` (pure transform + layout) → `renderHtmlPdf()` → Puppeteer
`setContent`. No report page is visited, so the export cannot be affected by
page state.

- **Separate card from the GL rollup.** 17293 aggregates to one row per
  gl_code + desk; this needs one row per transaction. Both read
  `materialized.item_log_report`. Nothing here touches 17293, so no other org's
  GL reporting is affected.
- **Tag types don't matter for this one.** The route reads the card's own
  registered parameter types from its public definition and echoes them back, so
  Date or Text both match, and the SQL casts the dates either way. An API edit to
  THIS card needs no re-flip in the UI — unlike every other card in this repo.
  (Metabase auto-typed `start_date`/`end_date` as Date on creation, from their
  names — worth knowing if you ever expect a new tag to default to Text.)
- **Not cached.** An export is pulled rarely and must be exact; a 4-hour-old
  ledger handed to a finance office is worse than a slow one.
- **Three GL states, not two:** code + account name; code with no `gl_account`
  row (`(no account name on file)` — Pawnee has two, 3334 and 886554); and no
  code at all (`(none)` → UNMAPPED, sorts last, flagged for review). Collapsing
  the middle case into UNMAPPED would misreport coded revenue as uncoded.
- **Enable a new org** by adding its slug to `MUNIS_EXPORT_ORGS` in server.js.
  Entity/department on the header come from the existing `getTylerConfig(slug)`;
  add `fiscalYearStartMonth` there if the org isn't on a July FY.
- `MB_GL_DETAIL_UUID` (Railway env) holds the card's public UUID. Unset ⇒ the
  button is hidden and the route 503s.

## Railway deploys

Railway project **lucid-possibility** (`37e39bf4-114d-446f-b7e3-5a8cedc7fafd`),
service **rental-report** (`7ee6e149-bd03-41db-bd42-aa8a751b1000`).

- **Production** deploys automatically from `main`. Never deploy untested code to
  production — pushing to `main` is a live release to all orgs.
- **PR previews** are created automatically when a PR is opened: an isolated
  environment named `rental-report-pr-<PR#>` with its own URL. This does NOT
  touch production.
- Preview URL pattern:
  `https://rental-report-rental-report-pr-<PR#>.up.railway.app`
  (e.g. PR #29 → https://rental-report-rental-report-pr-29.up.railway.app)
- After opening a PR, confirm the preview actually boots and hand Dan the URL.
  NOTE: the session sandbox's outbound proxy blocks `*.up.railway.app` (CONNECT
  403), so I cannot curl the preview to verify it. Verify boot via Railway
  `list-deployments` on the PR environment instead — status `SUCCESS` means it's
  up for Dan's browser even though I can't reach it.

## Admin "What's New" popup

The dashboard "What's New" popup shows *published* project-updates (the same ones
org admins see) — it is EMPTY until at least one update is published, and each PR
preview is a fresh environment with its own (empty) data store. So a brand-new
preview shows no popup until you publish an update in it first.

## Facility report undercounts revenue — invoice_v2 gap (OPEN, spec'd 2026-08-06)

The facility report (`FACILITIES_SUMMARY` card + `public/facilities.html`) only
counts `order_item`s joined by `reservation_id`. Every **manual invoice line
item** — tournament flat fees, event-space rentals, deposits, janitorial/
security/timing fees billed through **invoice_v2** — has no `reservation_id`, so
the report silently drops it. Verified against prod (db 4): **$2.57M missed
across 74 orgs** ($1.61M paid, **$964K unpaid A/R**). Some orgs show a *minority*
of true facility revenue (Chico 84% missed, Jurupa 80%). Apex misses $91K
(NJST rental $66K, tournament flat fees, service fees).

- **Correct charge field is `applied_pricing->'result'->>'finalCents'`**, NOT
  `order_item.price` (rate-card; comped-to-$0 bookings keep a price → a fictitious
  ~$95K Apex "unpaid balance" that does not exist). Collected/refunded come from
  `order_item_transaction` gated on `confirmed_at IS NOT NULL`.
- **Second bug in the same card**: `DISTINCT ON (fr.id)` collapses each booking to
  its earliest reservation — drops recurring-date revenue and mis-attributes
  court/location/date. So per-site/per-location filtering isn't robust for
  recurring/multi-court managed rentals (fine for Apex single-court instant).
- **The fix (BUILT, shipped in PR #76, then ROLLED BACK in #77 — perf):**
  rebuilt the card to (1) per-reservation grain, (2) union in invoice_v2 manual
  items (`finalCents>0`, no reservation) attributed to the rental's location,
  (3) show **billed vs collected** side by side. Goal per Dan: an *authoritative*
  facility-revenue view — instant + managed + invoiced/paid + invoiced/unpaid —
  sliceable by site type, location, date range (Brad@Marquardt-Miles pickleball
  vs Tim@Apex Tennis Center).
- **Current state:** `sql/facilities-summary-v2.sql` = the rebuilt query, saved
  as Metabase card **19570** (public UUID `4c070d95-ab02-4b9d-ac43-ac86257162d5`,
  date tags flipped, sharing on). `public/facilities.html` already has the
  billed/collected UI, gated on a `hasBilled` flag → **dormant** because
  `FACILITIES_SUMMARY_UUID` in server.js points back at the original card
  `4defd1b6…`. Flipping that one line re-activates it.
- **Why rolled back:** the v2 card is ~24s warm vs the old card's ~18s — not the
  real problem. The 502 "upstream error" came from the post-deploy **cold-cache +
  prewarm storm**: prewarm fires the heavy query for all ~74 orgs at once, and
  cold that query is far slower (60s+), so Metabase queued and edge requests
  timed out. **Before re-shipping: optimize the v2 SQL cold time** — the `oit`
  CTE aggregates the org's *entire* order_item_transaction ledger (not windowed)
  and there are several full-org order_item scans; scope those to the feed's item
  set. Then re-point the UUID and re-warm off-peak / stagger prewarm.
- Full write-up artifact:
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/b7b77323-5b23-463a-8f04-480f528effbe

Already shipped (PR #75, live on `main`): name-based site-type recovery so
"court" excludes rinks/pools/gyms, specific-type revenue breakdown, Location
filter, Ice sub-tab, court-name wrap. Display/scoping only — did not change the
revenue math, so the gap above predates and survives it.

## PINNED IDEA — printable "posting sheet" for the rented location (not built)

Dan, 2026-08-20. A sheet maintenance can print and hang **at the facility** so
anyone walking up knows what is booked: rental name, group/reservee, date and
times, facility/site, and a **scannable QR code** to the permit or rental.

Why it is worth doing: staff on site have no way to answer "who has this field
right now, and are they supposed to?" without calling the office. Today the only
artifact is the whole weekly schedule, which is the wrong shape for a fence post.

What already exists that this can lean on:

- `renderHtmlPdf(html)` in server.js — server-rendered HTML → PDF via Puppeteer
  `setContent`, no page visit, added for the Munis export. A posting sheet is the
  same shape of job: fetch rows → lay out → stream a PDF.
- The facility card already returns `Reservation ID`, rental name, reservee,
  location, facility/court and begin/end times — no card change needed.
- The deep link is already used by the Rec-link column in `public/facility.html`:
  `https://www.rec.us/admin/o/{orgId}/facility-rentals/{resId}` — that is the
  natural QR target for staff. **A public/permit-facing target would need a
  different, non-admin URL** — worth settling before building, since a QR taped
  to a fence is world-readable.
- QR generation is not in the repo yet; needs a dependency (e.g. `qrcode` to a
  data URI) or a server-rendered SVG.

Open questions for Dan: one sheet per reservation or one per site per day?
Does the QR go to the admin record (staff) or a public permit view (anyone)?
Per-org opt-in like the Munis export, or on for everyone?

Per the standing rule, ship it with a Slack activity ping when it is built.

## Dev branch

Feature work for these tasks lives on `claude/facility-report-line-removal-1d0c8k`
(same branch name in both `rental-report` and `rec-dashboard`).
