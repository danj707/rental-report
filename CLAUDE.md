# Project notes for Claude

## Working preferences (from Dan, dan@rec.us)

- **Always share the Railway PR-preview URL** whenever I open a PR for this repo,
  without being asked — Dan wants to click through the change before merging.
- **Wire a Slack activity notification into every new user-facing surface** —
  new features, buttons, export/download options, and other notable interactions
  should ping the Slack activity feed, without being asked. Dan wants visibility
  into what's being used (and enjoys the vanity of seeing plays/exports roll in).
  See the section below for the exact mechanism.

## Slack activity notifications — wire every new surface (IMPORTANT)

Standing rule (see Working preferences): any new button, export, download, or
notable interaction ships WITH a Slack activity ping. Don't wait to be asked.

The mechanism lives in `server.js` under "Slack activity notifications":

- `SLACK_NOTIFY` — the Set of event names that actually post to Slack. Add the
  new event name here or it stays silent.
- `SLACK_EVENT_META` — `{ emoji, verb }` per event; the default message reads
  `${emoji} ${orgName} (\`slug\`) ${verb} *${report}*`. Add a custom branch in
  `notifySlack()` if you need extra fields (see the `email` / `game` branches).
- Debounce: `notifySlack()` dedups by `${org}|${report}|${event}` for
  `SLACK_DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_MS` (60s). Give an event a custom debounce key there if
  distinct sub-events (e.g. per-game, per-recipient) should each post.
- Server-side events (a route the server handles, e.g. the Puppeteer `pdf`) call
  `logEvent(org, report, event, req, extra?)` directly — it appends to the events
  JSONL AND calls `notifySlack`.
- Client-side events (things the server can't see — a client export, a button
  click, a mini-game) beacon `POST /:org/:report/api/log?event=<name>[&extra=…]`
  (fire-and-forget, `keepalive: true`), and the event name must be in that route's
  `ALLOWED` list. Pass extra context as query params and thread them through as the
  `extra` object into `logEvent`.

Wired so far: `created`, `org-deleted`, `pdf`, `excel`, `print`, `summary`
(🧾 lite export), `game` (🕹️ hidden banner mini-game plays), `view`, `insights`,
feedback/votes, `email`, `munis`, `permits`, `map`, and three platform alerts —
`report-down` (a report's card stopped answering, links straight to the report
with its token), `schema-break` (a table or column the reports depend on is
gone), `param-drift` (a date template tag is no longer typed Date). The three
alerts debounce at 6h and @-mention if `SLACK_MENTION_USER_ID` is set. Inert
unless `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set (prod has it).

## Metabase card updates via API/MCP — template-tag types reset (IMPORTANT)

Updating a card's SQL through the Metabase API/MCP (`construct_native_query` +
`update_question`) regenerates ALL template tags as **Text** — date tags lose
their Date type, so this server's `date/single` parameters stop matching and the
public card returns "An error occurred." (the app then serves stale cache).
**After ANY programmatic card update, Dan must open the card in the Metabase UI
and flip each date variable (Start Date / End Date) back to type Date.** Batch
card updates so Dan can do all the flips in one visit, verify with a
server-style parameterized request afterward, and never assume a card update is
done until that verification passes.

**This is now watched automatically (PR #134).** `checkCardParamTypes()` in
server.js reads every served card's public definition daily at 5:40 and once
after boot, and Slack-alerts (`param-drift`) on any `start_date`/`end_date` that
is not a `date/*` type. It reads definitions only — no query is executed, so it
cannot time out on a heavy card, and it cannot fix anything: only the Metabase UI
can flip a tag back to Date. Check it on demand at `/api/admin/param-drift`.
It does NOT replace the verification above; it is the net for when someone
forgets.

## Card sign-off — a report MUST return live results before you call it done (IMPORTANT)

Learned the hard way (2026-08-06 → 2026-08-09): the shared Fast Track card was
edited and started **timing out** for large orgs (`canceling statement due to
statement timeout`). The app silently fell back to stale cache, so the report
kept *looking* fine while every live refresh failed — and the daily health
check was fooled the same way (it saw a warm cache hit and never re-probed
Metabase). **Nobody noticed for 3 days.** A warm/stale cache masks a card that
no longer returns fresh data, so "it still renders" is NOT proof it works.

**Rule: after ANY card edit (SQL, template tags, or a Metabase upgrade), confirm
the card actually returns fresh, non-empty rows via a cache-independent live
request — for the HEAVIEST org (biggest = worst case for timeouts), not a small
one.** Never sign off on a warm-cache render alone.

Tooling for this:

```
node scripts/verify-report-live.js --manifest scripts/report-cards.manifest.json
```

It hits the Metabase **public** card endpoint directly (same URL + parameter
shape server.js uses, incl. the required parameter `id`), so no app cache can
hide a broken card. It **fails (exit 1)** on error, empty result, or timeout.
Add a `{card, org}` row to `scripts/report-cards.manifest.json` whenever a new
shared card or large org is onboarded, and run it as the last step of every card
change. Single-card form:
`node scripts/verify-report-live.js --card <uuid> --org <orgId> [--start --end --timeout --min-rows]`.

## Tyler/Munis "GL Account Detail" export (card 20197) — PARKED, button off

**Status 2026-08-21 (Dan): switched OFF for every org.** `MUNIS_EXPORT_ORGS` in
server.js is now empty, which hides the button and 404s the route. The manifest
row for the card came out too, so the daily check stops paying for a 1.23 GB
scan on a report nobody is pulling.

Not broken — parked. Every pull is a full seq scan of
`materialized.item_log_report` (27-48s; see the section below), the export is
not in real use yet, and the table view eng is building may remove the need for
this card altogether. Revisit when someone actually needs a Munis file, or when
that table view lands.

**Nothing was deleted**: `lib/munis.js`, the route, `sql/gl-account-detail.sql`
and card 20197 are all intact. To switch back on, add the slug to
`MUNIS_EXPORT_ORGS` and re-add the `{card, org}` row to
`scripts/report-cards.manifest.json`.

Everything below describes how it works when enabled.

The 🏛️ **Tyler** button on the GL report (Pawnee only) streams a Munis-format
`glgatddt` account detail — PDF for reading, `.csv` for loading. Server-rendered:
`lib/munis.js` (pure transform + layout) → `renderHtmlPdf()` → Puppeteer
`setContent`. No report page is visited, so the export cannot be affected by
page state.

- **Separate card from the GL rollup.** 17293 aggregates to one row per
  gl_code + desk; this needs one row per transaction. Both read
  `materialized.item_log_report`. Nothing here touches 17293, so no other org's
  GL reporting is affected.
- **Tag types don't matter for this one.** The route reads the card's own
  registered parameter types from its public definition and echoes them back, so
  Date or Text both match, and the SQL casts the dates either way. An API edit to
  THIS card needs no re-flip in the UI — unlike every other card in this repo.
  (Metabase auto-typed `start_date`/`end_date` as Date on creation, from their
  names — worth knowing if you ever expect a new tag to default to Text.)
- **Not cached.** An export is pulled rarely and must be exact; a 4-hour-old
  ledger handed to a finance office is worse than a slow one.
- **Three GL states, not two:** code + account name; code with no `gl_account`
  row (`(no account name on file)` — Pawnee has two, 3334 and 886554); and no
  code at all (`(none)` → UNMAPPED, sorts last, flagged for review). Collapsing
  the middle case into UNMAPPED would misreport coded revenue as uncoded.
- **Enable a new org** by adding its slug to `MUNIS_EXPORT_ORGS` in server.js.
  Entity/department on the header come from the existing `getTylerConfig(slug)`;
  add `fiscalYearStartMonth` there if the org isn't on a July FY.
- `MB_GL_DETAIL_UUID` (Railway env) holds the card's public UUID. Unset ⇒ the
  button is hidden and the route 503s.

## The `materialized` schema has no secondary indexes (PINNED, spec'd 2026-08-21)

**PINNED, not being worked (Dan, 2026-08-21).** The table view eng is building
may make this moot, and the one surface that felt the pain — the Tyler export —
is switched off, so nothing is pulling this data today. Do not start on it
without checking in; the write-up below is here so the diagnosis does not have
to be redone.

Still worth passing to whoever owns the Epsio pipeline whenever it next comes
up, because **card 17293 has the same problem** and is hidden only by its
4-hour cache.

**DECISION (Dan, 2026-08-21): if it is ever fixed, the fix is an index on the
materialized table. Do NOT rebuild the card on base tables** — that re-derives finance logic the item
log already encodes, and any divergence would be silent, in a document handed to
a finance office. The base-table numbers below stay only as evidence for how
much an index buys.

The Tyler export failed on a normal month-end pull. `materialized.item_log_report`
carries **exactly one index** — the primary key on `epsio_id`. Nothing on
`organization_id`, nothing on the date column. So every read is a parallel seq
scan of the whole multi-org table:

```
Parallel Seq Scan on item_log_report  (cost=0.00..153217.93 rows=3)
```

Pawnee for one month: **27-48s on a quiet network to return 171 rows**, longer
while a deploy prewarms ~28 orgs into the same Metabase. Shipped mitigations
(PR #121) only buy headroom: request budget 90s → 150s, and a 60s result cache
so PDF-then-.csv is one scan instead of two.

**A join does NOT fix this** — asked and answered, with EXPLAIN:

```
Nested Loop  (cost=1000.14..147177.30)
  ->  Index Only Scan on organization       (1 row)
  ->  Parallel Seq Scan on item_log_report  ← unchanged
```

`WHERE organization_id = X` is already the tightest restriction there is. With
no index, "restrict" means "read every row and discard the misses"; a join just
puts a nested loop on top of the same scan. Same reason a sargable date
predicate buys nothing here — there is no index for it to use.

### This is systemic, not one table

EVERY table in the `materialized` schema has exactly one index — its primary
key. Nothing is indexed on `organization_id`:

| table | rows | size | indexes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `booking_report` | 1,349,340 | 1560 MB | 1 (pkey) |
| `item_log_report` | 2,259,449 | 1230 MB | 1 (pkey) |
| `transaction_report` | 1,005,767 | 976 MB | 1 (pkey) |
| `membership_and_pass_purchases_report` | 120,963 | 132 MB | 1 (pkey) |

So every card reading them scans the whole thing for one org, and the app's
4-hour cache is the only reason that is survivable. Card 17293 (the GL rollup
every org loads) has the same problem and is simply hidden by its cache — the
exact failure mode the card sign-off rule above exists to catch.

### The ask (platform / whoever owns the Epsio pipeline)

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY item_log_report_org_period_index
  ON materialized.item_log_report (organization_id, datetime_at_primary_timezone);
```

- These are **ordinary tables** (`relkind = 'r'`), not Postgres materialized
  views, so `CREATE INDEX` behaves normally — no REFRESH semantics to work
  around.
- Selectivity is the whole argument: Pawnee is **1,682 of 2,259,449 rows
  (0.07%)**. Today every pull reads 1.23 GB to return 171.
- **Caveat worth raising with them:** the pkey is named
  `population_temp_<uuid>_pkey`, which suggests the table is built under a temp
  name and renamed on repopulation. If so, a hand-added index would be dropped
  on the next full rebuild — so the index needs to belong to the Epsio
  definition, not be bolted on afterwards.
- Indexes must be created on the primary; the read replica Metabase uses cannot
  carry its own.
- The same argument applies to `booking_report` and `transaction_report`.

### Rejected: rebuild card 20197 on base tables

Kept for the measurement only — see the decision at the top. The base tables
are indexed, and one index is named for this exact job:

```
order_item_transaction_item_log_period_index
  ON order_item_transaction (organization_id, confirmed_at)
  INCLUDE (payment_id, refund_id, gl_code)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND confirmed_at IS NOT NULL AND credit_id IS NULL
```

Measured against it, same org + month: **464ms, identical 171 rows** — versus
27-48s. That is the size of the prize an index on the materialized table would
also capture, without re-deriving anything.

Field mapping (mat-view column → base source):

| view column | base source |
|---|---|
| `order_item_transaction_{id,amount,gl_code,confirmed_at}` | `order_item_transaction` |
| `transaction_type` | `payment_id IS NOT NULL` → payment, `refund_id` → refund |
| `transaction_method` | `payment.payment_method_type` / `refund.payment_method_type` |
| `transaction_event_batch_id` | payment/refund `.transaction_event_id` → `transaction_event` |
| `order_item_{name,type,fee_category}` | `order_item` |
| `desk_location_name` | `transaction_event.desk_location_id` → `desk_location` |
| `customer_*` | `users` — **path not yet confirmed** |
| `datetime_at_primary_timezone` | `confirmed_at AT TIME ZONE <org tz>` — **rule not confirmed** |

**Keep the date filter sargable.** Convert the local bounds to instants:

```sql
oit.confirmed_at >= ( {{start_date}}::timestamp        AT TIME ZONE tz)
AND oit.confirmed_at <  (({{end_date}}::date + 1)::timestamp AT TIME ZONE tz)
```

NOT `(oit.confirmed_at AT TIME ZONE tz)::date BETWEEN …` — wrapping the column
is exactly the mistake that makes the current card unable to use an index even
if one existed.

### Two things to settle before writing it

1. **Timezone.** The view stamps ONE timezone per org — Pawnee is
   `America/Los_Angeles` for all 1,682 rows even though it has a location in
   `America/Chicago`. Majority-location-timezone reproduces that for Pawnee,
   Smyrna and Watertown, but that is an inference about Epsio's rule, not a
   reading of it. Picking wrong slides transactions across midnight in a
   finance document. `organization.config` holds no timezone key.
2. **Customer name path.** `order_item` → order → customer user, unverified.

### Sign-off gate (this is a finance document)

FULL OUTER JOIN new against old on `order_item_transaction_id` over **at least
12 months** for the heaviest org, and require: zero rows present in only one
side, zero field-level diffs on date/amount/gl_code/type/method/batch/customer,
and debit/credit/net totals equal to the cent. Anything less is not sign-off —
see the card sign-off rule above.

Why this was rejected: the two unknowns above are both places where a wrong
guess is silent and wrong in a finance document, and the sign-off gate needed to
retire that risk is most of the cost of the work. An index gets the same speed
while the numbers keep coming from the definition finance already trusts.

## Railway deploys

Railway project **lucid-possibility** (`37e39bf4-114d-446f-b7e3-5a8cedc7fafd`),
service **rental-report** (`7ee6e149-bd03-41db-bd42-aa8a751b1000`).

- **Production** deploys automatically from `main`. Never deploy untested code to
  production — pushing to `main` is a live release to all orgs.
- **PR previews** are created automatically when a PR is opened: an isolated
  environment named `rental-report-pr-<PR#>` with its own URL. This does NOT
  touch production.
- Preview URL pattern:
  `https://rental-report-rental-report-pr-<PR#>.up.railway.app`
  (e.g. PR #29 → https://rental-report-rental-report-pr-29.up.railway.app)
- After opening a PR, confirm the preview actually boots and hand Dan the URL.
  NOTE: the session sandbox's outbound proxy blocks `*.up.railway.app` (CONNECT
  403), so I cannot curl the preview to verify it. Verify boot via Railway
  `list-deployments` on the PR environment instead — status `SUCCESS` means it's
  up for Dan's browser even though I can't reach it.

## Admin "What's New" popup — REMOVED from admin (PR #134)

Feature updates are for org admins, not for the person who wrote them, so the
popup now appears only on the ORG dashboards (`public/org.html`). The
`adminWhatsNew` block is gone from the admin dashboard in server.js.

Still true of the org-side popup: it shows *published* project-updates, so it is
EMPTY until at least one update is published, and each PR preview is a fresh
environment with its own (empty) data store — a brand-new preview shows no popup
until you publish an update in it first.

## Campsite map — public, un-retired, seed-scoped (Dan, 2026-08-22)

`campmap` is out of `RETIRED_REPORTS`. It was retired in favour of the Facilities
hub's Camping tab, which is right for ADMINS and wrong for campers: the Camping
tab is behind the org token, and `/:org/campmap` is the only **public, no-token**
view of a campground. It never stopped working — it has been quietly serving
~24 visitors a month via direct links the whole time it was "retired". Bringing
it back was surfacing it, not rebuilding it.

- **Seed presence is the whole gate.** The org landing route pushes `campmap`
  only when `CAMPMAP_SEEDS[slug]` exists, same shape as the facility permit chip:
  the card appears where there is a map and nowhere else, so the other ~26 orgs
  never see a link to an empty map. Two orgs qualify today — `douglas-county-nv`
  (Topaz Lake, 41 sites) and `pleasant-hill`. Nothing to configure for a new org
  beyond adding its seed.
- **The card link deliberately omits the token, and that is load-bearing.**
  `org.html` appends `?token=` to every other card, but on THIS page the token
  does more than authenticate — it unlocks drag-to-edit. A staff member copying
  the address bar to send to a camper would otherwise hand over an editable map
  *and* the org token that opens every other report for that org. `cardHTML()`
  routes `campmap` to `publicMapCardHTML()`, which renders a token-free href, a
  PUBLIC badge, and a "Copy link" button so sharing is deliberate. Verified in a
  real browser: the campmap href is `/{slug}/campmap` while a normal card is
  `/{slug}/gl?token=…`.
- Copying the link fires `campmap-share` (Slack), per the standing activity rule.
  Public page views already logged `view`, so camper traffic was pinging Slack
  even while the report was retired.
- Editing still works for admins exactly as before — open the page WITH `?token=`.

## The admin dashboard is a template literal — check its JS before shipping (IMPORTANT)

**The trap, and it has now bitten twice.** The whole admin dashboard is one giant
JS template literal inside `server.js`. That means every character destined for
the browser passes through TWO parsers: server.js's literal first, the browser
second. The literal eats one level of escaping.

2026-08-22, shipped to production in PR #137: a status string written as

```js
'Watching — alerts if a card\'s Start/End Date tag …'
```

The `\'` collapsed to a bare `'` on the way out, so the browser received an
unterminated string, threw a SyntaxError, and **discarded the entire 201KB
`<script>` block**. Every function declared in it was undefined and *every button
on the admin dashboard silently did nothing*. The only visible symptom was
`Uncaught ReferenceError: clearAllDrift is not defined` on whichever button was
clicked first — which points at an innocent function that was defined correctly.

**Nothing in CI could see it.** `node --check server.js` passes (server.js is
valid — the broken code is a *string* inside it). The specs pass (none render the
page). `ci-boot-check` passes (the server boots and serves the page happily).
The bug existed only in the browser, in generated code, which nothing looked at.
The earlier backtick incident in this same literal was the first bite.

**Now guarded: `node scripts/ci-check-admin-js.js`** (in CI). It boots the
server, fetches `/`, and checks the generated HTML two ways:

1. every inline `<script>` block parses (catches the escaping class), and
2. every inline `on*="handler()"` names a function that is actually declared
   (catches a button wired to a renamed or deleted function).

Verified against the real bug: reintroducing that apostrophe makes it report the
syntax error **plus 20 orphaned handlers** — i.e. it reproduces the symptom Dan
saw, not just the cause.

**Rules for any change to the admin dashboard:**

- Run `node scripts/ci-check-admin-js.js` before pushing. `node --check` is not
  enough and never was.
- **Prefer rewording over escaping.** Inside this literal, an apostrophe in
  emitted JS needs `\\'`, a backtick needs escaping, and `${` needs care. The
  fix here removed the apostrophe rather than double-escaping it, because the
  next person editing the line would have to re-derive the same reasoning.
- A single broken string takes out EVERY button in its block, so the blast
  radius of a typo here is the whole panel, not one feature.

## Watchdog switches in the admin dashboard (Dan, 2026-08-22)

Three toggles in the admin **Feature Flags** block, same switch as the existing
flags and the same `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` gate:

| flag | stops |
|---|---|
| `schemaBreakAlerts` | the catalog check + `schema-break` |
| `paramDriftAlerts` | the card date-tag check + `param-drift` |
| `reportDownAlerts` | the `report-down` alert (health check still runs) |

**OFF means off everywhere.** Each flag kills the scheduled check AND its alert,
so flipping one does not leave a check burning Metabase time and painting the
panel red. The gates live in three places on purpose: the scheduled entry point
(`checkCatalogDrift` / `checkCardParamTypes` return `{skipped}`), the alert site
(`alertable = active && watchdogEnabled(...)`), and `notifySlack()` as a
backstop. All default **ON**, and a missing/unreadable flag file means watching
— the failure direction must never be silence.

- **A manual run still works while muted** (`opts.force` bypasses the scheduled
  gate; `notifySlack` keeps it quiet). Looking without being paged is the point.
- **`report-down` is different from the other two**: the health check keeps
  running and the panel still shows the failure — only the announcement stops.
  A card that cannot answer is worth seeing on the panel either way.
- **Toggling posts to Slack** (`watchdog` event) with what stops being noticed,
  and @-mentions on OFF. Deliberately NOT in `ALERT_FLAG_BY_EVENT` — the notice
  that a watchdog went quiet must not be silenced by the switch it reports.
  `WATCHDOG_FLAG_META` holds the label/consequence copy; the dashboard confirm
  dialog says the same thing before the switch flips.
- `/api/admin/flags` **POST now rejects an unknown key.** It used to accept any
  key and write a flag nothing reads, which looks like a working toggle and is
  not one. Only `DEFAULT_FLAGS` keys are settable.
- State is readable on `/api/admin/schema-break` (`enabled`),
  `/api/admin/param-drift` (`enabled`) and `/api/admin/report-activity`
  (`reportDownAlerts`) — check these first when an alert did not fire.

## Alerts only fire for reports that are actually used (Dan, 2026-08-22)

**Rule: don't alert on a report nobody uses; once it's used, it joins the alert
set on its own.** Nothing to configure and nothing to remember — the events log
already knows, so the watchdogs ask it. `getReportActivity()` in server.js reads
`events.jsonl` over `REPORT_ACTIVITY_WINDOW_DAYS` (default **45**, cached 1h) and
answers `isReportActive(slug, rt)` / `isReportTypeActive(rt)`.

What that gates:

- **Health check** — inactive org/report pairs are not probed at all (saves the
  Metabase time too) and are recorded as `status: "inactive"` so the panel says
  *why* rather than showing a stale tick. An inactive failure never enters the
  failures list, the count, or the email.
- **`schema-break`** — fires only if a dropped table/column breaks an **active**
  report, and the message names only those. Full diff stays in the state file.
- **`param-drift`** — fires only for a card serving an active report.

Three traps this is built around, all of which fail silently if you get them
wrong:

1. **Activity counts EVERY usage event, not just `view`.** The six Program
   Summary bands (`selfservice`, `program-checkins`, `program-demographics`,
   `retention`, `checkins`, `section-detail`) have **zero** `view` events by
   design — they're fetched by `programs.html` for 15 orgs apiece. View-only
   activity would stop watching the most-used reports on the platform.
2. **`report-down` must not count as usage.** It's logged against the real
   org/report, so counting it would let a broken unused report alert once,
   qualify itself as active, and keep alerting forever. `NON_USAGE_EVENTS` is a
   denylist (not an allowlist) so a new export counts as usage the day it ships.
3. **An empty log means watch everything.** A missing events file, a fresh
   volume, or a new PR preview is not evidence that 22 reports went unused.
   `/api/admin/report-activity` reports `failsafe: true` when that's in effect.

`/api/admin/report-activity` is the first place to look when an alert did NOT
fire.

**The bands are now in `REPORT_DEPENDENCIES` (2026-08-22).** They were the
largest hole in that map for exactly the reason above — no `view` events, so they
looked unused, while ~15 orgs each depend on them. Tables and columns were read
out of the live card SQL (19174 selfservice, 18547 program-checkins, 17722
program-demographics, 18151 checkins, 17953 section-detail, 17298 calendar) and
validated against the schema-catalog card before shipping: **22 reports declared,
54 tables, 700 column declarations, zero missing.** Only `annual-report` (dead)
and `qoq` (derived from the GL card, no card of its own) have no entry.

Two of calendar's dependencies have *already* been through the break this map
exists to catch — `class`/`class_activity` and `section_price` were both dropped
and the card migrated — which is the argument for declaring the rest before it
happens again. Deliberately not the cache's `isReportHot()` (3+ opens in 7 days) — right
question for holding rows in memory, wrong one for "does anyone rely on this".

Usage as of 2026-08-22 (log starts 2026-05-22, so ~3 months): dead are
`overview` (8 opens ever, none in 90d, orphaned page — still in
REPORT_DEPENDENCIES) and `annual-report` (3 opens, last 51d). `court-utilization`
as a *page* is dead (2 views/30d) but its **card is load-bearing** —
`facilities.html` pulls it 174x/30d across 13 orgs, so don't retire the card with
the page. `campmap` is in `RETIRED_REPORTS` yet has 24 views/30d across 2 orgs,
so it's more alive than the other two retired reports.

## Health-check alert noise — what caused it, and the three guards (2026-08-22)

Dan got ~20 `report-down` alerts in an afternoon for reports that were all still
serving. Diagnosis, cache-independent: the cards were **slow, not broken**.
`clarksville/roster` returned its 1337 rows in **7.7s one hour and 59.8s the
next** against a 60s budget; `apex/fasttrack` and `apex/ice-calendar` both blew
past 70s. Every marginal miss was one Slack message.

**Partly self-inflicted.** PR #134 pointed the 28 shadowed per-org rows at the
real shared cards (correct for *which* card, wrong about *how many times*). The
per-org loop's comment always said "only reports with a per-org mbUuid" — the
shadowed entries defeated that, so each run fired ~28 extra heavy Metabase
queries against the same cards the shared loop already probes once, which pushed
those cards over their own timeouts. Watchdog as its own load source.

**And two of the ten were never slow — they were health-check bugs.** Probing
with the error body captured showed:

- `_shared/programs` → `missing-required-parameter: end_date, start_date`. The
  probe sent **org_id only, never dates**, so any card with REQUIRED date tags
  failed on *every* run. A permanent false alarm no flap protection can silence
  — and it returns 200 with 15 rows the moment the dates are passed. Cards with
  *optional* date tags were worse in a quieter way: they ran with no date filter
  at all, i.e. the whole table instead of one window, which is a large part of
  why these probes sat on the 60s timeout. `chat-data` fixed exactly this bug
  ("the old path used stale per-org UUIDs with no dates/org_id → cards errored →
  empty"); the health check still had the old shape. It now calls
  `buildMetabaseParams({}, rt, orgId)` like the report route does.
- `_shared/qbr-stats` → last actually checked **2026-07-06**. `_shared` was
  exempt from the stale-entry purge, so when qbr-stats joined
  `HEALTH_SKIP_REPORTS` its `error` row was never re-probed and never cleared —
  47 days in the failure count for a report nothing was looking at. The purge
  now sweeps `_shared` for report types that are skipped or no longer shared.

**Slow is not broken, and only broken alerts (Dan, 2026-08-22).**
`classifyProbeFailure()` splits the two:

- **slow** — a client-side timeout, a Metabase 5xx, or a `statement timeout` /
  `canceling statement` behind an HTTP 400. It could not answer in time *this
  time*; the app serves those from cache anyway. Status `slow`, amber on the
  panel, never a failure, never an alert, and a slow round **resets** the broken
  streak rather than feeding it.
- **error** — the card cannot answer because of what it IS: a dropped table or
  column (`relation "class" does not exist`), a renamed or newly-required
  parameter, an unshared or deleted card (404), a SQL error. These do not fix
  themselves, so they alert — after two consecutive rounds, and only for reports
  in use.

Four guards, all in `runHealthCheck`:

1. **One probe per card.** The per-org loop skips anything
   `resolveReportCard(slug, rt).shared` — the `_shared` row covers that card.
   Per-org probes **31 → 3** (only `norman/gl`, `smyrna/historic`,
   `apex/ice-calendar` have genuinely per-org cards), so a full sweep is
   **45 → 17** probes. Stale per-org rows are purged, or the panel keeps showing
   their old failures forever. Note this is where essentially all of the load
   reduction comes from — activity gating currently removes no probes at all,
   because the 3 surviving per-org combos and all 14 shared types are in use. Its
   value is suppressing `schema-break`/`param-drift` on dead reports and covering
   reports that fall out of use later.
2. **`HEALTH_ALERT_AFTER` (default 2) consecutive failures** before a report is
   called down. One miss is load; two rounds in a row is evidence. `failCount`
   resets on any success, and `lastAlertedAt` is carried across recoveries so a
   card flapping either side of its timeout cannot re-alert every few hours.
3. **The error says what Metabase said.** A statement timeout comes back as HTTP
   400 with the reason in the body, so bare `HTTP 400` could not distinguish a
   dropped table from a slow card — opposite problems, opposite fixes. The body
   (160 chars) is now in `entry.error`, and it is what `classifyProbeFailure()`
   reads.
4. **Slow never alerts** — see above. This is the guard doing most of the work,
   since most of what was firing was cards sitting near their timeout.

Worth knowing separately: **several cards genuinely run near or past 60s, and
how near is wildly variable.** Shared `roster`, same card and same 7-day window,
measured four times on 2026-08-22: **7.7s → 32.9s → 46.3s → 59.8s** (the 59.8s
run was undated — see the probe bug above). Shared `programs` came in at 52s
once and **timed out past 90s** on a quiet retry. `qbr-stats`, `apex/fasttrack`
and `apex/ice-calendar` all exceed 70s (the latter two are in `NO_DATE_REPORTS`,
so no window narrows them).

**Caveat on any timing taken from this sandbox:** a local `node server.js` boot
prewarms ~28 orgs and generates annual-report snapshots against the *production*
Metabase, so measurements taken while one is running are inflated by your own
load. Kill local servers before timing anything.

That spread is the argument for the slow/broken split: the same card, unchanged,
can answer in 8s or not at all depending on ambient load, so a single timeout is
not evidence of anything. It is a real performance problem, deliberately NOT
alerted on — see the `materialized` index section. Amber on the admin panel and
nowhere else.

## Per-org card entries a shared card shadows (know this before trusting ORGS)

`ORGS[slug][report].mbUuid` is NOT necessarily the card the app queries. A
`SHARED_UUIDS[report]` card wins for every report **except `gl`**, where a
per-org card takes precedence. 28 per-org entries are currently shadowed this
way — dead config the report routes never read, and at least two of them
(clarksville and smyrna `roster`, cards 15712 and 15709) still JOIN the dropped
`class` table and fail outright.

**Always ask `resolveReportCard(slug, rt)`** rather than reading `mbUuid`
directly. The daily health check did not, which is how it reported
clarksville/roster, smyrna/roster and norman/products as down on 2026-08-22
while all three loaded fine — it was grading reports against legacy cards.
Fixed in PR #134; `scripts/card-drift.spec.js` fails if that regresses.

The shadowed list is on `/api/admin/param-drift`. Consequence worth remembering:
removing a report from `SHARED_UUIDS` will silently start serving whatever stale
per-org card was hiding underneath it.

## Facility report undercounts revenue — invoice_v2 gap (OPEN, spec'd 2026-08-06)

The facility report (`FACILITIES_SUMMARY` card + `public/facilities.html`) only
counts `order_item`s joined by `reservation_id`. Every **manual invoice line
item** — tournament flat fees, event-space rentals, deposits, janitorial/
security/timing fees billed through **invoice_v2** — has no `reservation_id`, so
the report silently drops it. Verified against prod (db 4): **$2.57M missed
across 74 orgs** ($1.61M paid, **$964K unpaid A/R**). Some orgs show a *minority*
of true facility revenue (Chico 84% missed, Jurupa 80%). Apex misses $91K
(NJST rental $66K, tournament flat fees, service fees).

- **Correct charge field is `applied_pricing->'result'->>'finalCents'`**, NOT
  `order_item.price` (rate-card; comped-to-$0 bookings keep a price → a fictitious
  ~$95K Apex "unpaid balance" that does not exist). Collected/refunded come from
  `order_item_transaction` gated on `confirmed_at IS NOT NULL`.
- **Second bug in the same card**: `DISTINCT ON (fr.id)` collapses each booking to
  its earliest reservation — drops recurring-date revenue and mis-attributes
  court/location/date. So per-site/per-location filtering isn't robust for
  recurring/multi-court managed rentals (fine for Apex single-court instant).
- **The fix (BUILT, shipped in PR #76, then ROLLED BACK in #77 — perf):**
  rebuilt the card to (1) per-reservation grain, (2) union in invoice_v2 manual
  items (`finalCents>0`, no reservation) attributed to the rental's location,
  (3) show **billed vs collected** side by side. Goal per Dan: an *authoritative*
  facility-revenue view — instant + managed + invoiced/paid + invoiced/unpaid —
  sliceable by site type, location, date range (Brad@Marquardt-Miles pickleball
  vs Tim@Apex Tennis Center).
- **Current state:** `sql/facilities-summary-v2.sql` = the rebuilt query, saved
  as Metabase card **19570** (public UUID `4c070d95-ab02-4b9d-ac43-ac86257162d5`,
  date tags flipped, sharing on). `public/facilities.html` already has the
  billed/collected UI, gated on a `hasBilled` flag → **dormant** because
  `FACILITIES_SUMMARY_UUID` in server.js points back at the original card
  `4defd1b6…`. Flipping that one line re-activates it.
- **Why rolled back:** the v2 card is ~24s warm vs the old card's ~18s — not the
  real problem. The 502 "upstream error" came from the post-deploy **cold-cache +
  prewarm storm**: prewarm fires the heavy query for all ~74 orgs at once, and
  cold that query is far slower (60s+), so Metabase queued and edge requests
  timed out. **Before re-shipping: optimize the v2 SQL cold time** — the `oit`
  CTE aggregates the org's *entire* order_item_transaction ledger (not windowed)
  and there are several full-org order_item scans; scope those to the feed's item
  set. Then re-point the UUID and re-warm off-peak / stagger prewarm.

Already shipped (PR #75, live on `main`): name-based site-type recovery so
"court" excludes rinks/pools/gyms, specific-type revenue breakdown, Location
filter, Ice sub-tab, court-name wrap. Display/scoping only — did not change the
revenue math, so the gap above predates and survives it.

## Facility rental "posting sheet" — BUILT (PRs #118, #120, #121)

The one-pager maintenance prints and hangs **at the facility** so anyone walking
up knows what is booked, with a **scannable QR** to the live permit.

- `lib/permit.js` — pure layout (no Express, no Metabase, no fs). `toHtml(sheets)`
  → one `.sheet` per page; the caller supplies each QR as a data URI.
- Server: `POST /:org/facility/permits.pdf` (client posts the rows it is showing,
  so the export honours on-screen filters) → `renderHtmlPdf(html, {plain:true})`.
  `GET /:org/facility/api/permits` feeds the per-row chip a thin `{code, url}`
  map. Slack event: `permits`.
- UI: `public/facility.html` — a per-row chip (own `showPermit` column toggle,
  default ON — do NOT gate it on `showLink`, which defaults off) and an
  "Export Permits" toolbar button over the filtered view.
- **The QR target is `https://www.rec.us/permits/{permitId}`** — no auth, which
  is what makes it safe taped to a fence. Confirmed by decoding the QR out of
  Rec's own permit PDF. The admin `/admin/o/{orgId}/facility-rentals/{resId}`
  URL is NOT usable here.
- Card **20230** (`sql/facility-permits.sql`, public UUID
  `6771e2fe-1d9c-41c1-a921-7d875115305e`, env `MB_PERMITS_UUID`). Issued permits
  only — a draft or revoked permit has no working public page, so a sheet for one
  sends staff to a dead link. Tag types don't matter for this card (the route
  echoes the card's own registered types back), so an API edit needs no re-flip.
- The permit code Rec prints is the **LAST** 8 hex of the permit id.
- Exports re-fetch permits live so a permit revoked since the last page load can
  never be printed; `PERMIT_LIVE_MAX_AGE` (60s) keeps back-to-back exports from
  each paying the full card time (Watertown's card is ~25s).

**Multi-day permits (2026-08-20).** A permit covers the WHOLE rental, and the
sheet goes up once at the start of a run and stays up — so printing only the
exported row's date tells a parks crew the field is booked for one afternoon when
it is actually booked every Friday until September. Card 20230 therefore emits
`Schedule` (JSON `{d,s,e,site}` per occurrence, **multi-date permits only**),
`Date Count`, `First/Last Date`, `Capacity`, `Attendees` and `Add Ons`, and the
sheet:

- **scopes the dates to the site it is hung at** — the Multipurpose Field's sheet
  must not list the same permit's Kitchen booking. Site key = `court.court_number`
  = card 17294's "Facility" column. No match ⇒ fall back to the whole run.
- prints **one sheet per permit per site**, not per row, once a permit is
  multi-date — otherwise a week of a recurring rental yields five identical pages.
- caps the date list at 32 **in JS**, not by CSS clipping, and says "+N more" — a
  sheet that quietly loses rows to overflow looks complete and is not.
- carries add-ons **without quantities**: they are billed per occurrence, so a
  40-date permit holds 79 rows of "Alcohol Permit".

**No per-org opt-in, by design** — the chip only appears where a permit exists,
so orgs that don't issue permits never see it. Nothing has to be "turned on"
for a new org: Douglas County was verified 2026-08-21 with zero issued permits
and behaved correctly before it had any (facility report 200, chip feed
`{permits:{}}`, export a clean 404 rather than an empty PDF), then lit up on
its own once permits were pushed through the same day. Their campsite data
suited the stay layout — 370 multi-day reservations in the next 30 days, up to
12 nights, and **zero** missing site names or capacities, so site scoping and
the capacity line both resolve.

The manifest carries a `facility-permits / douglas-county-nv` row. It ran at
`minRows: 0` while they had none; permits were issued 2026-08-21, so the
override is gone and it uses the default of 1 like every other row — an empty
result now fails, which is the point of the check.

How these are actually used (Dan, 2026-08-21): permits cover essentially ALL
facility reservations, and multi-day is mostly campsites though not exclusively.
Campsite sheets generally will NOT be printed and posted at the site — so for
that segment the per-row chip matters more than the bulk export, and the stay
layout is there to be correct rather than because a crew is hanging it on a
post.
